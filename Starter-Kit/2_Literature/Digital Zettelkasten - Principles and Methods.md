**Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples**

1. A bicycle for the mind

Page 6 · Location 74

A Zettelkasten–especially a digital one–is a bicycle for the mind.

2. Low-effort production for a distracted world

Page 7 · Location 84

Zettelkasten method hijacks our short attention spans to help us be productive. If you have a few minutes in the waiting room at the dentist, which are you going to choose: dig into a big project such as reading a dense book, or kill time with social media? When you have a digital Zettelkasten, there’s a third option: do small things with small notes, straight from your phone.

3. Caveats about this book

Instead of using my brain power to try to remember things, I'm using it to write better articles, newsletters, and books. I finally found a bicycle for my mind.

The most helpful book I came across in building my own Zettelkasten was Sönke Ahrens’ How to Take Smart Notes. But I still had to figure out a lot on my own. This book is the guide I wish I had when I was starting.

6. Misconceptions corrected

But the proper way to take notes is not to copy things word-for-word (except in the case of exact quotes). Instead, you [[re-write]] it in your own words, which is even more powerful. Second, you don't write down everything you read. You only write down the important things: Things that are interesting, relevant to your work, or that you otherwise want to retain.

DuckDuckGo

Search engines and the internet are not a substitute for your notes. Your notes contain more than just simple facts, managing your notes builds your memory, and your notes help you store and develop ideas in-progress.

7. Digital or paper?

digital notes are better than paper:

**Fleeting Notes**

Highlight(blue) - Page 34 · Location 330

The purpose of a fleeting note is to say, "here's something interesting I might want to remember or refer to some day." You need to record just enough information to later decide whether you want to turn your fleeting note into a literature note, permanent note, or someday/ maybe.

**Literature Notes**

Highlight(blue) - Page 35 · Location 341

Literature notes are informal summaries you write about a piece of media you've consumed.

Highlight(blue) - Page 35 · Location 347

literature notes are in your own words. To write literature notes, you have to think about what you learned, and how you might explain it to a friend (or your future self). This helps you remember the material better than you would otherwise.
